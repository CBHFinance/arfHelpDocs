# Overview

## User Interface

The homepage for the Appointment Request form will display a list of existing form entries, with a navigation pane on the left, where all areas of the application are accessible.

The navigation pane contents will vary based on the users access.

## Form Process

When a form is created and submitted, it goes through several approval steps.

### Department Approval

    B["Request Submitted to Department"]
    B -- Rejects --x D["Return To Originator"]
    B -- Approves --> C["Submitted to Finance For Approval"]
  end 
    style A color:#003768, fill:#CAFDF5,stroke:#003768
    style B color:#503001, fill:#FFF5CC,stroke:#FFAB00

    style subgraph_deptApproval fill:none
    linkStyle 1 stroke:#B71D18,fill:none

Once the department approval is complete, the person who who submitted the request will be notified via email of the outcome.

## IT Setup

Once the form has completed all of the approval steps, it is sent to IT for user setup. Once completed, the person who submitted the appointment request as well as HR will be notified by email.
